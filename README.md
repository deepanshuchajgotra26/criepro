This is a repository regarding our Final year project titled as "Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness by Video Streams from Camera" Introduction: In a classroom, there may be a scenario where the students are not attentive. In such scenarios learning outcome is not achieved. In such scenarios, the teaching effectiveness is reduced and students are not able to grasp the content of the lecture properly. Sometimes the teacher is also not aware that the teaching effectiveness of the lecture has reduced. In order to solve this problem, we have proposed a solution where we would analyze the overall attention of the students present in a classroom. The information gathered about the overall attention of the class will help both the students as well as the teacher to monitor the overall teaching effectiveness during a lecture. The proposed system analyses the overall attention of the students present in a classroom and generates an Attention Index for the whole class. Here Attention Index is used as a metric for measuring the overall attention. The Attention Index is calculated for the whole class. The Attention Index is monitored. An alert is sent to the teacher if the attention falls below a threshold.
